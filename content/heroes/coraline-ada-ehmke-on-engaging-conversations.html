  On 2021-08-29 I was interviewed by
  <a href="https://sb.cofc.edu/academics/academicdepartments/management-and-marketing/faculty-staff-listing/hansen.php">
    David J Hansen
  </a>
  for "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm8lnsh1xUtoZqHggd48m_A">Engaging Conversations</a>",
  a series of interviews with Industrial/Goth/Post-Punk DJs and artists.</p>
<p>
  We had a great talk, covering topics like the creative process, world-building
  with music, mental health, and the power of storytelling.</p>
</p>
<p>
  The hardest question he asked me was,
  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WTNahE1Mcg&t=783s">What does music mean to you?</a>"
</p>
