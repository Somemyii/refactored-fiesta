  On 2021-05-09 I took part in <a href="https://droneday.org">Drone Day</a>,
  a 24-hour, <a href="https://droneday.org/events.html">global</a> celebration
  of drone, tone, soundscaping, and more. Streaming live for 2 hours, I
  created a song called "The Punk", inspired by an
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDogh7J1-5s">Irish talk show</a>
  from 1982. It was a great opportunity to use my
  <a href="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/moffenzeef-stargazer-purple.html">Stargazer drone synth</a>.
  Something, from nothing, to something.
