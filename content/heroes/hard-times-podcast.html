<p>
  I got my <em>very first music review</em> on 2021-12-14, on the
  <a href="https://fanboys.libsyn.com/the-industrial-episode">Hard Times 'Fanboys' Podcast</a>!
  Starting around the 27:23 mark, they talk about "The Punk", my experimental piece
  from this year's <a href="#drone-day">Drone Day</a> festival.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"It made me feel a way that drone music never has, that was really really cool"</li>
  <li>"It could be in the soundtrack for Prometheus"</li>
  <li>"It's creepy, it's haunted, but also a little bit uplifting. You feel wonder."</li>
  <li>"It's 99% of the way there, just that high end was brutal. Roll off some of the piercing high frequency; it takes you out of the sense of wonder"</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I can't thank <a href="https://twitter.com/REALpunknews">@REALpunknews</a> enough for the
  kind words and constructive feedback. You can listen to the song itself
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/sets/the-punk-wip">on Soundcloud</a>.
