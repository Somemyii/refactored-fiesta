<p>
  A collaboration with composer and experimental musician
  <a href="http://www.errant.space">Craig Chin</a>. The name is a reference to the band we were
  in together in the 90s, <a href="https://www.jagshouse.com/music/uncle_karma.html">Uncle Karma</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Craig and I take turns adding or removing layers to compose these pieces.
  I have a one-take rule: I can either accept my first take for a given
  instrument, or throw it away. No do-overs!

  You can listen to Auntie Kismet on <a href="https://auntiekismet.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>.
