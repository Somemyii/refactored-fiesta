      <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/tower">Tower</a>, a
      one-chord instrumental inspired by Swans. This song comes from
      <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/album/arcana-unfinished">Arcana</a>,
      an unfinished 2020 concept album based on the Tarot. I absolutely love the
      slow build.

       A very personal album the explores my relationship with
       mental health challenges, including Bipolar Disorder, suicidal ideation,
       dissociation, and anxiety.

       is one of my favorite tracks on this album, inspired by a word I made up
       in a dream.

        <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/if-only-today-we-could-wake">If Only Tonight We Could Wake</a>,
        which I wrote as a sequel to one of my favorite Cure songs.
