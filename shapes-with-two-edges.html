<p>
  A collaboration with synth pop duo <a href="http://eloquentmusic.com">Eloquent</a>.
  They keep giving me major keys, so I keep reaching for
  <a href="https://musictheoryonline.com/natural-harmonic-and-melodic-minor/">harmonic minors</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For each song in this collaboration, we "ping-pong" back and forth adding
  new parts and rearranging the structure until we're happy with it.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://twitch.tv/djrascer">Randall Scott</a> creates most of the
  synth tracks, so I mainly focus on guitar, (spending a lot of time with
  an ebow.
</p>
<p>
  This collaboration is an experiment to see what happens when crisp, precise,
  crystalline digital meets messy, analog, and atmospheric. The name comes
  from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon">obscure Euclidean degenerate</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We've got plans for a 4-song LP, digital and vinyl.
